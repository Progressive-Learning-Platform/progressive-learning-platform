# Progressive Learning Platform

The Progressive Learning Platform (PLP) is a novel, open, adaptable, multi-course Computer Engineering curriculum and technology platform developed with the help of funding from NSFâ€™s research initiation grant in engineering education (RIGEE) program. It is designed to improve student learning by closing gaps between courses in a computing curriculum, and showing students the connections among the concepts and skills they learn in different courses. PLP brings active and collaborative learning to the classroom, and has been shown to engage students and help them with gaining and retaining knowledge.
