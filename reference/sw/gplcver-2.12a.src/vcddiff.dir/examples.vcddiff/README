This directory contains some simple examples to demonstrate the use
of vcddiff.  To run the tests, execute the shell script: vcddiff_test.sh.
This will run four examples using the dump files provided and print out the
differences.  

To run vcddiff just give two dump files to compare.  This script runs
the following four tests.  The '//' comment lines below give the expected
output for each of the tests.

$  vcddiff example.dump example.dump   
// no differences since it is the same file

$   vcddiff example.dump example_map_nochg.dump   
// no differences since it is the same file, except for different identifiers
                                        
$   vcddiff example.dump example2.dump   
// will print the differences between the files 

$   vcddiff --state example.dump example2.dump   
// will print the differences between the files in the state form, since the
   --state command is given 

For more information see README.vcddiff in the top level directory.
