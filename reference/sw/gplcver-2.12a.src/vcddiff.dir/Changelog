   *** SEE THE VCDDIFF README FOR MORE INFORMATION OF NEW BEVAHIOR ***

   - All values that didn't have a previous value are initialized, and 
     seen in edges as '?'.

   - Added '-wrap' option.  This option when used with edge printing, wraps
     the line after every 11 edges.  Therefore 11 edges are printed per line
     followed by a '\', to indicate a new line.  An empty line indicates
     the start of the second signal value on the next line.  Default
     no longer wraps

   - Added the ranges '[a:b]' to the signal name

   - If one value is narrower than the other they are right aligned at low 
     bit side.
  
 Bugs
  -  add_signal(), filled one too many bits in intialization
  -  add_edges(), last bit print was wrong 
  -  get_time_diffs, need to rewind() prior to seeking
