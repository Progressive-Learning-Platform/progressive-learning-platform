                     RUNNING THE CAPACITY TEST

This directory contains a 3.2 million gate circuit that requires about
150MB of memory to run.  Circuit is a shift register from John Hillawi's
DA Solutions bench marks and is used with permission.

To run the test type:

  ../../bin/cver -f lfsr.vc

Then type: 

  diff verilog.log lfsr.plg

to check for correct output.  The diff command will print minor differences
such as date, time, memory use depending on you system.
The +printstats option prints out circuit size statistics.

Also, try running the lfsr_udp.vc to see 50k gate version of same circuit
coded using udps.
