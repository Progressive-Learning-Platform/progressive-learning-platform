This directory contains a number of test directories.  Each directory
contains a README file with specific instructions for running the
tests (usually how to run the test shell script).  Directories are: 

install.tst:

 Installation test.  This test runs cver on various Verilog files to insure
 correct build.  It should always be run.  

examples.tf:

  Examples of PLI 1.0 tf_ interface routines.  The test script uses
+loadpli1= option to make dynamic libraries (.so files) and then runs
the test.

examples.acc:

  Examples of PLI 1.0 acc_ interface routines.  The test script uses
+loadpli1= option to make dynamic libraries (.so files) and then runs
the test.

examples.vpi:

  Examples of PLI 1.0 acc_ interface routines.  The test script uses
+loadvpi= option to make dynamic libraries (.so files) and then runs
the test.

capacity.tst
  This option test runs a 3.2 million gate circuit to show advantages of
non flattened algorithm.  It requires about 150MB of free memory.  Running
it is optional.

v2001
  This directory contains some tests for new verilog 2001 features supported
by GPL Cver 2.xx.
