==Dependencies==

plpc needs GNU flex, GNU bison, gcc, and libarchive in order to build. If you're on a Debian based machine, you can do:

apt-get install flex bison gcc libarchive-dev

and that will likely get you there.

==Building==

With that done, just call make from the top of the plpc tree, which should be the same place as this file.

If successful, you should have the entire toolchain in ${PLPC}/bin.

You'll need to add the plpc binary directory to your path.

==Testing==

The makefile tries to run tests on a successful build, which requires that you have two environment variables set.
You need to have ${PLPC}/bin in your PATH variable, and you need to have $plptool set to "java -jar $PLPPATH/PLPTool.jar"
