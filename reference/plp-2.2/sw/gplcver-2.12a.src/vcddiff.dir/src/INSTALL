To install just typing 'make -f makefile.youros' should work on most systems, since it has only one source file and header file, getting it to compile 
shouldn't be a problem. Where 'youros' is lnx, sparc, or osx, depending 
on your OS.  

The executable is placed in the bin directory in the main Cver level. 
See the README.vcd file one level up for more  information on vcddiff.
