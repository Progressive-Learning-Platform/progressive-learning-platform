               RUNNING THE GPL CVER V2001 TEST

First run Cver without any arguments to make sure Cver binary is
correctly installed.  Type "../../bin/cver" or if you have installed cver
somewhere on your shell PATH just type "cver".  The first line output
Cver version number must match the version of your release directory.  If
version number does not match, you probably have your shell PATH environment
variable set to execute an old version.

If you are running on Unix/Linux based platforms, run the shell command
script by typing:

inst_tst.sh 

Correct installation is indicated by the following message with no diff
command output lines before the message:

>>>> V2001 test completed (this should be only printed message).
