hello.v    - A Verilog version of the hello world program. 

helpgen.inp, helpgen2.inp, helpgen3.inp  - '-i' input scripts to generate all
       help screens onto the screen and into the verilog.log file. To run it
       type "cver -s -i helpgen.inp [some Verilog source file]".

gatenots.v - 14k heirarchical inverter circuit with monitoring so that during
       simulation every wire is observed.  It requires the simb.mem memory
       file in this directory.  The circuit consists of chains of inverters
       with an even number so all outputs settle to the input value after
       each pattern is applied.
