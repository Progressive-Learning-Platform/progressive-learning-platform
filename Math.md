## First Meeting ##

---

> -Decided on how the overall project will run.

> -Get a group understanding of our goals.

> -Create a timeline of events building up to the due dates.

> -Decide which mathematical functions we will be making.

> -Split up into two teams that would work on projects independently, then integrate later.

> ### Possible Functions ###

## Second Meeting ##

---

> -Updated everyone on the progress each group had made.

> -Continued to think about which functions we would like to add or remove from our potential list.

> -Wiki manual was updated with each function that will soon be implemented.

> -Max's Plans (11-1-2011)
    1. Source code for some of the functions:
    1. negative, Sign, Absolute Value, Add, and Subtract.
    1. negative: "Not" every bit, then add one.
    1. Sign: Return the highest bit of the register.
    1. Absolute value:
    1. Add: Just add...
    1. Also, We have to find a way to check if we've overflowed: If Overflow, then result<Some Starting value, I think.
    1. Subtract: Multiply second value by -1, then just add.

_Bolded functions are completed_

-Completed our presentation for ~~Tuesday~~ Thursday.

-Decided that the square root algorithm will be the one used to compute square roots by hand.

-Test function completed.

> (From Josh)-"To use it you place the function name where is says to at the top of the code.

> Run it, and type in an 8 digit decimal number into the UART, press SPACE to store the number.

> Enter another 8 digit decimal number and press SPACE again to store it.

> Then press the + button to put those two stored values into $a0 and $a1 and call the function.

> After returning from the function the contents of $v0 are then printed to the screen.

> This should also work with single variable operations (i have tested it only with the abs function though).

> By default, Fritz's maximum function is used."
