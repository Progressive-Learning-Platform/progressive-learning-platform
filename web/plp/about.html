  <p class="html_marginless">The progressive learning platform is an FPGA based computer architecture learning platform. It is intended to expose students to the a wider scope of computer architecture design principles beyond the usual topics covered in an undergraduate course. This includes the typical core concepts - data path, control, pipelining, etc., with other additional, critical concepts such as full system integration, programmability, and other design trade-offs on a wider scope than the core architecture.</p>
  <p/>
  <p class="html_marginless">This is accomplished with a problem-based curriculum that takes teams of students through a complete system on a chip (SoC) design. The included reference design includes a MIPS-like cpu with surrounding system components including a VGA controller with framebuffer, UART, gpio/switches/buttons/leds, interrupt controller, memory controller, and more all connected through a standard front side bus. The system is designed to be used in conjunction with student designs. Additionally, software tools, including a simple 2-pass assembler, board communication tools, and a cycle accurate simulator are included. All host software tools are written in Java to be OS agnostic.</p>
  <p/>
  <p class="html_marginless">The reference design is implemented in Verilog and is fully synthesizable in Xilinx Webpack ISE. The reference board is the Digilent Nexys 2</p>
